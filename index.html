        <h1>1955</h1>
        <p>
          Timothy John Berners-Lee was born in London on 8 June 1955, the son of mathematicians
          and computer scientists Mary Lee Woods (1924-2017) and Conway Berners-Lee (1921-2019).
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>1973-1976</h1>
        <p>
          From 1973 to 1976, he studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA in physics.
          While there, he made a computer out of an old television set he had purchased from a repair shop.
        </p>
        <h1>1978</h1>
        <p>
          After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Poole, Dorset.
          In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create typesetting software for printers.
        </p>
        <h1>1980</h1>
        <p>
          Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980. While in Geneva, he proposed a
          project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. To
          demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.
        </p>
        <h1>Late 1980</h1>
        <p>
          After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth,
          Dorset. He ran the company's technical side for three years. The project he worked on was a "real-time remote
          procedure call" which gave him experience in computer networking. In 1984, he returned to CERN as a fellow.
        </p>
        <h1>1989</h1>
        <p>
          In 1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe
          and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the
          Internet.Robert Cailliau joined Berners-Lee as a partner in his efforts to get the
          web off the ground. They used similar ideas to those
          underlying the ENQUIRE system to create the World Wide Web.
